**Executive Summary**
This report outlines the analysis of an existing information system, the in-house Call Management Centre (CMC), at a major travel agency. It will offer a proposal of an improved system, that will provide assistance to employees at the agency, Relationship Managers (RM), so that they can provide a high quality, efficient service for customers, in order to improve company sales. In order to elicit requirements and generate an understanding of the overall system, analysis of the company’s description was undertaken, and any gaps in understanding were assumed.

**Problem Definition**
Choosing travel packages can be time-consuming and difficult due to the vast amount of information available online. 
The first step in design thinking is to emphasise with the customer to determine their requirements for the new system. 
Empathising with the customer means to observe, listen and engage with them.
Second step is to define the problem once the customer needs are understood. 
Furthermore, the new system will allow calls from customers to be routed to certain relationship managers 
who can help them choose the right holiday package.
The relationship manager will differentiate customers on the basis of the Profiler tool which contains 
all of the customers information like name, age, and culture.
The information provided in the Profiler will increase the possibility of the relationship manager 
landing and closing a sale with the customer. 
The information provided in the Profiler allows the relationship manager to build a connection with the customer 
which is vital in making a sale. 
Thus, the call management system will add significant value to the organisation and will help improve current work processes.
Therefore, the CMS will provide a way to automate current processes within the travel company which currently require human intervention. 

Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to introduce an upgraded call management centre system,
to improve the operations of a major travel company, helping them generate more sales. 
Due to the varying number and nature of their products, holiday packages, their current system is complicated, 
so the new system aims to provide a tool which simplifies this, and matches customers with specific Relationship Managers 
who can provide tailored services according to their skill profiles. 
The project implementation will enable the ability to provide a more specific
and efficient service and establish strong customer relationships, resulting in repeat sales.

- RMs have the ability to transfer customers on the call to different RMs who are more knowledgeable about the travel packages that are being discussed
- Customers are aware of the different packages being offered through the media advertisement

Point of view statements (POV)
Relationship Manager
Relationship Managers need a way to improve the CMC system because the company would like to attract more end-customers.
Relationship Managers need a way to connect with customers easily, because it makes their work more efficient.
Relationship Managers need a way to more effectively use their skills and product knowledge, because it would help create more sales.

End Customer 
End customers need a way to communicate in a simple manner with the travel agents in order to obtain the information we require 
End Customers need a way to be matched with a helpful and knowledgeable relationship manager because we need to be able to efficiently communicate our travel plans
End Customers need a way to get assistance rapidly, because we don’t like to wait for long periods of time on a call.
End customers need a way to be assured that my personal data is being protected when using the CMS because of the need to maintain data confidentiality 



**'How Might We' Statements**
Relationship Managers

HMW improve the CMC to attract more end-customers?
HMW connect with customers more easily to make their communication with the customer more efficient?
HMW effectively use our skills and product knowledge at an extensive level to help increase our sales?

End-Customers

HMW communicate with the travel agents in a simple manner to get the information we need?
HMW match with a helpful and knowledgeable RM to efficiently talk about or holiday plans?
HMW get the assistance we need quickly enough to not keep us waiting on the phone for too long?
HMW ensure that our personal data is being protected while using the CMS to help maintain data confidentiality 



Reflection on Assumptions 

After analysing the travel company’s situation, it is assumed that there are enough Relationship Managers (RMs) every day, 
and the same RMs are hired on a full-time work type, meaning they have the same shift every day of the week, 
maintaining consistency of their service offering. All RMs are assumed to have basic knowledge of all travel packages 
being offered by the travel company, however are not required to specialize in all product areas. Hence, RMs are assumed 
to have the capability to be able to transfer their customer on a call to a different RM, who can assist their specific 
requirements. This may occur if the first RM was wrongly matched to the customer by the system, if the RM knows that another 
RM can handle their customer’s enquiries better, or other relevant reasons. Additionally, it is assumed that customers have 
the ability to discover the different packages the travel company offers, through other media platforms such as advertisements,
a website and social media.
